1. Ensure your video file is in a compatible format (e.g., .avi, .mp4).
2. Place the video file directory in the MATLAB script replacing "Add your own video directory".
3. Run the code
4. The first frame of the video will be displayed. Define the analysis region by selecting the start point.
5. The script will process each frame, extract grayscale intensity values along the selected lines, and calculate mixing index (MI). The MI values will be plotted vs time.
6. The script will generate a plot of MI vs. time and results will be saved in an excel file with name and directory to be provided by the user.
